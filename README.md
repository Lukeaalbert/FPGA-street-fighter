### Introduction
This project aims to recreate a Street Fighter like game in Verilog (the hardware description language). It is intended to be synthesized for and ran on a Nexys A7 FPGA.

The remotes for playing are made from standard push buttons (for attack and shield) and a 5-position switch (used as a joystick).
